Two api route for getting the data from the data dumb, which is about the FIFA database and done using Spring boot framework


Hello everyone, I'm excited to introduce you to our Spring Boot-driven FIFA database application. We've carefully designed two API
routes that provide seamless data retrieval from our dataset. These routes grant you direct access to the wealth of information within the
FIFA database. The first route is designed to fetch player details based on a range of filters, tailoring results to your preferences. On the other hand,
the second route delivers comprehensive team statistics, offering deeper insights into team dynamics and performance. With the robust capabilities of Spring Boot's
framework, we've ensured a smooth and efficient data retrieval process. This setup empowers you to effortlessly explore FIFA-related data for players and teams alike.
Our aim is to facilitate efficient querying and offer a user-friendly experience, making interactions with the FIFA database both intuitive and enlightening.
